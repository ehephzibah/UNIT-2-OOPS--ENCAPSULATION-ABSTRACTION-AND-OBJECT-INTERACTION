# UNIT-2 OOPS – Encapsulation, Abstraction, and Object Interaction

This repository contains Java projects developed as part of UNIT-2 in Object-Oriented Programming. The focus of this unit is on implementing core OOP concepts such as Encapsulation, Abstraction, Interfaces, and interaction between objects through real-world based projects.

---

## Concepts Covered

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Interfaces
- Abstract Classes
- Data Hiding
- Method Implementation
- Object Interaction
- Modular Class Design

---

## Projects Included

### 1. Mini Project – Employee Management System (Interface)

This project demonstrates the use of Interfaces in Java to define a contract for employee operations. Interfaces are used to ensure consistency while allowing different classes to provide their own implementation. The project manages employee details and operations using structured and modular design.

**Concept Used:** Interface  
**Purpose:** To achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance of type  
**Focus:** Method declaration, implementation, and object interaction

### 2. Project 1 – Bank Account System (Encapsulation)

This project demonstrates Encapsulation by restricting direct access to class data and allowing access only through controlled methods. Sensitive data such as account balance is protected using private access modifiers and accessed using public getter and setter methods.

**Concept Used:** Encapsulation  
**Purpose:** Data hiding and controlled access  
**Focus:** Private variables, public methods, secure data handling

### 3. Project 2 – Employee Payroll System (Abstraction)

This project demonstrates Abstraction by defining common properties and behaviors in abstract classes while allowing subclasses to implement specific functionality. It focuses on hiding internal implementation details and exposing only essential features.

**Concept Used:** Abstraction  
**Purpose:** Hide complexity and show only necessary features  
**Focus:** Abstract classes, method overriding, structured design

## Learning Outcomes

Through these projects, the following skills are developed:

- Understanding core Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Designing modular and reusable classes
- Implementing abstraction using abstract classes and interfaces
- Protecting data using encapsulation
- Improving program structure and maintainability
- Applying OOP concepts to real-world scenarios

---

## Technology Used

- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming Principles
- Command Line / VS Code
- Git and GitHub for version control
